// gpio_blinkled.rs - Blinks an LED connected to a GPIO pin in a loop.
//
// Remember to add a resistor of an appropriate value in series, to prevent
// exceeding the maximum current rating of the GPIO pin and the LED.
//
// Interrupting the process by pressing Ctrl-C causes the application to exit
// immediately without resetting the pin's state, so the LED might stay lit.
// Check out the gpio_blinkled_signals.rs example to learn how to properly
// handle incoming signals to prevent an abnormal termination.
